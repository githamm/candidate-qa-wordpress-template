<strong>Why are you running for office?</strong>

I am running for Douglas County Commissioner because I want to keep a watchful eye on how taxpayer dollars are spent, keep a lid on any new sales and property taxes, and ensure that our county’s prosperous growth and development continue yet is balanced so that we do not change our way of life. I have a proven track record of shrinking government while improving services as Douglas County Coroner from 2011 to 2015. I am qualified to oversee and manage a $350 million+ annual budget, and as a retired Major with the Colorado State Patrol, I have experience developing and implementing public policy, working collaboratively with other agencies to benefit our community and managing public sector budgets.  Finally, I hold a finance degree and an MBA.

<strong>What is the biggest problem you see with your party?</strong>

I believe the Republican and Democratic Parties have forgotten about government by the people and for the people. Voters in both parties are dissatisfied with their elected officials, resulting in more and more voters identifying as Unaffiliated.  This political cycle is unlike any I have ever experienced.

<strong>What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?</strong>

The biggest policy issue that separates me from my opponent is our stance on raising taxes.  In 2007, I fought a 33% increase on the mill levy for the Law Enforcement Authority on our property taxes.  Not only did my opponent support the tax increase in 2007, in 2009, minutes from the Public Safety Advisory Committee to the Sheriff's Office indicate that she would like to see the issue of raising the taxes brought before the public in 2011.

Secondly, I will not vote to accept any federal block grants that contain the HUD's new Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) requirements.  I will not give the federal government authority over our local zoning decisions.  My opponent has stated that she will accept those grants because "it is our money" and that groups such as the Women's Crisis Center depend on those funds. 

Congested roadways and transportation gridlock are problems that need to be addressed but I will not support light rail as the solution.

<strong>What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?</strong>

Douglas County is a great place to live, work and play, and we both want to serve the citizens.  We both see the value in volunteering for various civic organizations that contribute to the high quality of life in Douglas County.

<strong>How has the sale of recreational marijuana in Colorado impacted your community?</strong>

As the County Coroner from 2011-2015, I saw the devastating impact of marijuana on our youth.  I will never forget listening to the father of a 17 year old suicide victim as the father detailed his child's year- long slide into failures in school, sports and personal relationships after a friend introduced him to marijuana.  Douglas County has lost homes to fires because of illegal grow operations.  And, these fires threatened surrounding homes, areas and other structures.  There is also concern for burglaries and home invasions when owners bring large sums of cash into their homes because banks are unable to accept cash from marijuana sales.

<strong>Are there any new regulations you see that need to be implemented regarding marijuana sales?</strong>

When Prohibition ended, strict controls were placed on alcohol.  After Amendment 64 passed in 2012, and marijuana was "legalized" the same kinds of controls were not put into place.  We were caught playing "catch-up" in regard to packaging and warnings on "edibles."  There is no "standard" that regulative the potency of THC in products.  Only after tragedies have taken place, are these controls being considered.

<strong>What is your position on growth? And how would you address issues regarding growth if you are elected?</strong>

I enjoy playing with my 3 year old granddaughter and sometimes wish she would never grow up because I love her innocence and her spontaneity, but that just isn't possible.  The same could be said for Douglas County - it's great the way it is today, however, I recognize that growth happens.  It brings new vitality to communities when it is managed appropriately.  Private property rights must be respected in balance with existing property uses, availability of water and other necessary infrastructure. NOTE:  I have not accepted campaign contributions from developers and I am not beholden to them.

<strong>How would you address the issue of affordable housing?</strong>

? The fact is home prices rise and fall due to supply and demand, and home prices are very high right now because the supply does not meet the demand.  Douglas County is experiencing a high level of growth currently which exacerbates the supply level problem and the increased prices of homes.  Partnerships and planning are keys to affordable housing.  (Resolving the construction defect stalemate on a local basis will provide options for affordable housing as well.)

<strong>Is the construction defects stalemate impacting construction of new townhomes and apartments?</strong>

It's frustrating that for the last two years, bills were proposed in the Legislature that could have resolved the construction defect issue but they failed for one reason or another.  And, yes, the lack of availability of this "residential ownership" product on the market is affecting Douglas County.  Not only does it prevent younger populations from being able to own their first homes, it prevents some older populations from having a smaller residence to own as they downsize.  As the representative in 2013 & 2014 from the Colorado Coroners Association at CCI (Colorado Communities Inc) I am aware that some communities like Lakewood were working on local resolutions to resolve this stalemate.  If no resolution from the Legislature is forthcoming, learning from Lakewood's approach to this ownership problem would be beneficial.

<strong>Why are you running for office?</strong>

To serve the People of Douglas County. As a small business owner, my philosophy is that “You make a living by what you do, but you make a life by what you give.” That explains why my family and I work hard at serving our community. We need more servant leaders, more business people in office, not career politicians. I am pragmatic, work cooperatively with diverse groups of people, and have a proven track record as a successful leader.

<strong>What is the biggest problem you see with your party?</strong>

The false perception that what happens in Washington, DC is somehow indicative of all levels of government. Douglas County is a thriving community in part because our county government knows how to stay out of the way.

<strong>What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?</strong>

Douglas County is a leader in the state and nation at attracting companies and jobs. Our unemployment rate is the fourth-lowest in the nation when compared to like-sized counties. Per capita income is now the fifth highest of any county in the nation. I believe economic development is central to the prosperity of our working families and the county. Continuing that track record of economic development success, addressing long-term transportation needs, and developing reusable water resources are critical to the future of Douglas County.

<strong>What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?</strong>

I think we share a belief that Douglas County is a great place but we have vastly different ideas on how to continue to move the County forward and what the role of government should be.

<strong>How has the sale of recreational marijuana in Colorado impacted your community?</strong>

Sale of marijuana is not allowed in unincorporated Douglas County.

<strong>Are there any new regulations you see that need to be implemented regarding marijuana sales?</strong>

To date, we have no medical or retail dispensaries in our county. I appreciate the local control provisions that allows diverse communities to address marijuana sales as best suits the majority of residents of a given jurisdiction.

<strong>What is your position on growth? And how would you address issues regarding growth if you are elected?</strong>

Owning a construction finance company has allowed me the opportunity to work in all areas of construction management. I am prepared to tackle our water issues, open space and infrastructure needs. We expect to see another 100,000 residents moving into Douglas County and we need visionary planning. We must ensure development occurs in identified development areas, while protecting the beauty and heritage of our rural areas.  We live in an amazing county that allows every resident the opportunity to live the lifestyle they want and I want to ensure future generations have those same opportunities in how they choose to live. It is important that we plan now for the expected growth to prevent our current residents from being negatively impacted.

<strong>How would you address the issue of affordable housing?</strong>

Affordable home ownership will continue to evade first-time homebuyers so long as supply is lacking. While I would continue to work with the General Assembly to achieve a statewide solution to construction litigation reform, it is encouraging that Douglas County and the communities of Parker and Lone Tree have proceeded with ordinances to address those issues at the local level.

<strong>Is the construction defects stalemate impacting construction of new townhomes and apartments?</strong>

Yes  Builders are not building multi-family attached for sale units and the fallback is expensive apartments. We have gone from 22% to 3% of the market being condos which provide options for not just first time home buyers but seniors looking to either downsize or have a lower maintenance home ownership option.  Construction litigation reform is necessary to meet the growing demand for owner-occupied properties including townhomes and condominiums.
